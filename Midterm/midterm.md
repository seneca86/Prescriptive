## Instruction

### Grading

This midterm is optional. Please put the following letter in the top right corner of your answer sheet:

* N: the grade of the midterm will not be considered
* Y: the grade of the midterm will be considered and will substitute the attendance grade

### Answers

There is one and only one correct answer. 

* Each correct answer is worth 1pt.

* Each incorrect answer is worth -0.5 pts.

* Each blank answer is worth 0 pts.


### Question 1:

The plot below represents a sensitivity analysis of a dependent variable `Net Profit` versus two independent variables `Proportion of Supers(%)` and `Demand`.

![Question 1](../Monte_Carlo/pictures/contour.png)

The sensitivity of the `Net Profit` to `Proportion of Supers(%)` is...

(a) Higher when the `Demand` is higher

(b) Lower when the `Demand` is around `150000` than when `Demand` is around `250000`

(c) Equal to the sensitivity to `Demand`

(d) Higher when the `Demand` is around `150000` than when the `Demand` is around `50000`

### Question 2

The plot below shows the cumulative distribution function of the output variable of the profit of the Wellyntoy company.

![Question 2](../Monte_Carlo/pictures/gassman_cdf.png)

Choose the correct statement:

(a) There is a 90% probability that the profit is £328,328

(b) There is a 5% probability that the profit is between 0 and £108,075

(c) There is a 5% probability that the profit is below 0.9 (approx.)

(d) There is a 30% probability that the profit is £225,000 (approx.)

### Question 3


![Question 3](../Monte_Carlo/pictures/sales_output.png)

Choose the correct statement:

(a) There is a 90% probability that the profit is £357,328

(b) There is a 5% probability that the profit is £54,465

(c) There is a 90% probability that the profit is between £54,465 and £357,328

(d) There is a 5% probability that the profit is £50,000 (approx.)

### Question 4

![Question 4](../Monte_Carlo/pictures/run_simulation.png)

### Question 9

![Question 9](../Optimization/pictures/sensitivity_report.png)

Choose the correct one (don't worry about the units or the converstion to 1,000s):

(a) Increasing the production of grade A tomatoes would bring a benefit of 600
(b) Increasing the production of grade B tomatoes would bring a benefit of 2,400
(c) Increasing the production of grade A tomatoes would bring a benefit of 271.5 for at least 600 additional tomatoes
