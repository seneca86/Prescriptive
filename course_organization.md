**In-person or Zoom:** Available after class or before class upon request.

## Subject Overview
This course focuses on **prescriptive analytics**, expanding upon the foundation laid in **Data Analytics for Managers**. Students will delve deeper into decision-making under resource constraints and risk assessment, with a particular focus on **optimization** and **simulation** techniques.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, you will have developed the following skills:
- Building complex decision models.
- Making data-driven decisions under constraints.
- Solving optimization problems.
- Conducting sensitivity analysis.
- Developing simulation models.
- Comparing and evaluating different decision-making approaches.

## Course Structure
The course includes 10 sessions, which will cover the following dimensions:
- **Lectures (20%)**: Focus on the theoretical background.
- **Discussions (20%)**: Active participation to deepen understanding.
- **Class Exercises (15%)**: Hands-on practice during class time.
- **Group Work (25%)**: Collaborative problem-solving and project work.
- **Individual Study (20%)**: Independent learning and preparation.

## Topics Covered
- **Decision-Making Frameworks**: Structuring managerial decision problems and framing decisions.
- **Optimization Models**: Building and solving optimization problems using tools like Excel and Solver.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Understanding the impact of changes in decision variables.
- **Simulation**: Applying simulation techniques to decision-making under uncertainty.

## Evaluation
Your performance will be evaluated based on:
- **Final Exam (40%)**: Open book and notes exam.
- **Group Assignments (20%)**: Two group assignments, each accounting for 10%.
- **Class Participation (20%)**: Active contribution during lectures and discussions.

## Course Policy on AI Tools
Generative AI tools may be used in specific cases, such as Excel formula generation, with proper acknowledgment. However, AI-generated content is not permitted in assignments, exams, or group submissions.

## Ethical Conduct and Attendance
Students are expected to adhere to the university's Code of Conduct and Attendance Policy. Any unethical behavior may result in failure of the course.

## Tentative Session Breakdown

### Sessions 1-2: Introduction to Decision Making
- Role of intuition and analysis.
- Structuring managerial decision problems.
- Practical Case: Red Brand Canners (HBS).

### Sessions 3-4: Building Decision Models
- Using Excel for decision models.
- Optimization with Solver.
- Sensitivity analysis.

### Sessions 5-7: Advanced Optimization Techniques
- Case: Wellyntoy Products - Dynatron.
- Building and solving more complex optimization models.

### Sessions 8-10: Review and Exam Preparation
- Revising key concepts.
- Final exam preparation.

## Some practical remarks

### Style and content
- Lectures will be light in math and heavier in applications
- Case and exercise discussions will showcase the decision tools 
- Despite the case-study style of the class, the core will be quantitative
- Participation is 20% of assessment 
- More than 30% absence from lectures and workshops will result in failing the course (unless excused)

### Tools
- The main analytic tool that we will use is Excel
- You will need some tools besides regular Excel: Solver (Excel) and @Risk (Palisade Decision Tools)
  
### Workshops
- Some of the sessions will consist of workshops instead of lectures 
- You will work on a project case assisted by the instructor
- Please sign up for your preferred work-groups before the next session
- Ideally you should form groups of three
- The workshops will take place in break-out rooms for each team
- Assignments will be based on workshops, managerial reports submitted electronically through Blackboard
- Deadline: each report will be due right before the next session
