## Summary

### Background

* Semiconductor manufacturer in Silicon Valley, California

* Spent $1 billion to build its Sunnyvale plant in 1999
Amortized to be $5,000 per lot per fab hr over the expected fab life

* A semiconductor is a material that has electrical conductivity to a degree between that of a metal and that of an insulator

* Semiconductors are the foundation of modern electronics (e.g., transistors, solar cells, LEDs, etc.)

### Setup of the case

* Who?

  * Mike Morris, Chief Operating Officer
  * Kelly Klein, VP of finance
  * Warren Wong, VP of sales
  * David Dunn, VP of manufacturing

* When?

  * Monday, 31 May 2004

* What?

  * To determine the production plan for July 2004 given all available information

  * How many of which chips to produce next month?
  * Should XMicron outsource?

### Silicon wafers:

* X401
* X402
* X403

## Production Process

- **# of raw wafers for July = 10,000**
  
- **25 wafers per lot**
